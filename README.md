# vehicle-detection
This repository is the outcome of my Final-year project and dissertation at the University of Westminster. This project was created in cooperation with the Intelligent Transport Infrastructure (ITI) group at the university. My role in this research was to develop a machine learning based detection model that was later compared to YOLO model developed by the ITI group. The outcome of this comparison is reflected in my dissertation and is to be published in ITI conference paper.
